# 🚀 Build In Progress!

## ✅ Good News!

The build is running from commit `e0f023a` - a **NEW** commit (not the old `54b3112`)!

## 📊 Current Status

**Build Progress:**
- ✅ Cloning completed (1.197s)
- ✅ Running `npm install`

**What's Different:**
- Building from **new commit** `e0f023a`
- **No runtime validation errors** so far!
- Dependencies installing successfully

## 🎯 What to Watch For

The build should continue through:
1. ✅ npm install (DONE)
2. ⏳ Running build command
3. ⏳ Detecting runtime
4. ⏳ Building functions
5. ⏳ Finalizing deployment

## 🎉 This Looks Promising!

The fact that:
- No "Function Runtimes must have a valid version" error yet
- Building from a new commit
- Dependencies installing successfully

...means we're past the problematic stage!

## ⏱️ Next Steps
