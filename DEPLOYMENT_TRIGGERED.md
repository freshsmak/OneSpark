# 🚀 Deployment Triggered!

## ✅ What Just Happened

1. **Empty commit created** - Forces Vercel to build from latest
2. **Pushed to GitHub** - Vercel will automatically detect and deploy
3. **Latest commit** - All fixes are included (vercel.json deleted, engines set)

## 📊 Current Status

- **Latest commit:** Just pushed (new hash)
- **Configuration:** ✅ All cleanup done
- **Vercel:** Should now deploy from this commit

## ⏱️ What to Expect

1. **Vercel will detect the push** (within 30-60 seconds)
2. **Build will start** - Check Vercel Dashboard
3. **Should see:** 
   - ✅ "Runtime: nodejs18.x" (auto-detected)
   - ✅ "Build Completed" (no errors!)
   - ❌ NO "Function Runtimes must have a valid version" error

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Watch Vercel Dashboard

Go to: **Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments**

You should see a new deployment starting within 1-2 minutes.

### 2. Check Build Logs

Look for:
- ✅ Build starts from **new commit hash** (not 54b3112)
- ✅ No runtime validation errors
- ✅ Build completes successfully

### 3. Test Your Live App

Once deployed:
- Visit your Vercel URL
- Test `/api/sparks` endpoint
- Test sign-in flow
- Generate your first spark! 🎉

## 🔥 You're Almost There!

The deployment is triggered. Watch the Vercel Dashboard - it should build successfully now that it's using the latest commit with all the fixes!

**This is it!** The spark is about to ignite! 🚀
