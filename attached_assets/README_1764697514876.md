# 🔥 ONE SPARK - Consumer Product Ideation Engine

Fully automated AI-powered product ideation. Run the script, get a novel consumer product concept with a beautiful visual card. No manual input required.

## What It Does

1. **Randomly selects** a consumer product category (kitchen, pet, travel, etc.)
2. **Extracts real pain points** from a curated database of Reddit/Amazon complaints
3. **Generates a novel product concept** using Claude AI
4. **Creates a premium product card** with name, tagline, features, and pricing

## Files

- `one_spark_pro.py` - Production version with Claude API integration
- `one_spark.py` - Basic version with pre-built concept database (no API needed)

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Basic Version (No API Key Needed)
```bash
python one_spark.py
```
Uses a pre-built database of product concepts. Good for testing.

### Option 2: Pro Version (Claude API)
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
python one_spark_pro.py
```
Generates truly novel, unique product concepts every time.

## Requirements

```bash
pip install pillow anthropic
```

## Sample Output

Each run generates:
- A PNG product card (1080x1920, Instagram story format)
- A JSON file with full concept data

## Example Concepts Generated

- **CloudCore** - "The pillow that never goes flat" - Modular pillow with subscription refills
- **TerraGlide** - "The rolling garden seat that follows you" - Ergonomic garden mobility
- **PawPod** - "See them. Treat them. From anywhere." - Pet cam with treat dispenser
- **CableCanvas** - "Your desk's hidden nervous system" - Integrated cable management

## Customization

Edit `CATEGORIES` list to focus on specific product areas:
```python
CATEGORIES = ["kitchen gadgets", "pet products", ...]
```

Add pain points to `PAIN_POINT_DATABASE` for better ideation:
```python
PAIN_POINT_DATABASE["your category"] = [
    "Pain point 1",
    "Pain point 2",
]
```

## Automation Ideas

### Daily Email Digest
```bash
# Add to crontab for daily spark at 8am
0 8 * * * cd /path/to/sparks && python one_spark_pro.py && ./send_email.sh
```

### Batch Generation
```python
for _ in range(10):
    run_spark()
```

## MVP Next Steps

1. **Landing Page**: Collect emails for "One Spark delivered daily"
2. **Web Scraping**: Add real-time Reddit/Amazon pain point extraction
3. **Image Generation**: Add DALL-E/Midjourney API for product renders
4. **Voting System**: Let subscribers upvote their favorite sparks
